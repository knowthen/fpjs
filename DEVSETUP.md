# Development Environment Setup Steps

1. install nodejs (nodejs) (nvm for mac and linux)
2. Verify git is install by opening up the command line and running the following command `git --version`. If you get a message saying 'command not found', then install git on you computer by following the instructions here: [Install Git](knowthen.com/gitinstall)
3. [CD](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)>) into a directory you'd like to put your code in, then clone the courses companion repo with the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/knowthen/fpjs.git
```
## Using the counter directory

4. CD into the new `fpjs/counter` folder.
5. Open this folder with your favorite editor. For example if your using [Atom](http://atom.io) like I am, you can enter `Atom .`, which opens atom with the contents of the current directory.
6. Install the dependancies with the following command `npm install`
